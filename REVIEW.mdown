Good stuff. I know the you're not finished with band landing pages, just keep this in mind for later:

- Try distro.lightbox instead of modifying $('#lightbox') directly. It's not much now, but will be needed later and I want to give its API a workout. API looks like this right now (`hide` is optional):

      distro.lightbox.show({
      	show: function(lightbox){
      		/* set up */
      		lightbox.$lightbox.haml(/* â€¦ */);
      	},
      	hide: function(lightbox){
      		/* clean up */
      	}
      });

- You should use distro.request instead of $.get; it has error handling (like 500s) and state handling (like session expiration)

- I think classes work better than ids for presence; they can be scoped to the presence ul.
- When this thing is closer to working, try using stencil to iterate through presence and only render the ones in the doc
- distro.lightbox handles fade in.
